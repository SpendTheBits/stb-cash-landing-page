            <ul>
              <li>
                Supported Fiat/Virtual Currencies: Do not attempt to store
                Fiat/Virtual Currencies in Your Wallet that are not supported by
                the Wallet, including any fiat currencies not facilitated by STB
                CASH.

              <li>
                {" "}
                Key Generation and Backup: When You create a SpendTheBits
                Wallet, the Software generates a cryptographic private and
                public key pair that you may use to send and receive any
                supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency
                network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF
                ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS,
                BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do
                not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the
                Services, you will not be able to access Virtual Currency
                previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we
                discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or
                may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. Also, in the
                event you delete the App and reinstall it and you lose your
                backup data, you will lose your Virtual Currency forever. We are
                not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf. Upon
                creating an STB CASH App Wallet, the Software does not generate
                any cryptographic private and public key pair. For the STB CASH
                App and transactions, different secure mechanisms are employed
                to ensure transaction security. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE
                SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET AND STB CASH CREDENTIALS,
                including username, password, identifiers, backup password
                phrases, and network addresses if applicable. Failure to
                maintain such a backup may result in the inability to access
                fiat funds within STB CASH in the event of data loss or
                discontinuation of the STB CASH app service. In the event of
                discontinuation of the STB CASH app service, the SpendTheBits
                team will notify customers at least 30 Day’s notice to withdraw
                funds from the platform.

                CASH app. SpendTheBits is not liable for fluctuations in the
                fiat or Virtual Currency value of your assets held in the Wallet

                capabilities.

                Transaction Confirmation: Virtual Currency transactions require

                network's ledger, which is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network
                not controlled by SpendTheBits. Transactions involving STB CASH

                STB CASH transactions, which are governed by separate
